## Communication Strategies in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Systems
Members: Ming Liu, Emily Bejerano, Andrea Su, Pair Phongphaew

This repository includes the environmental and test code used to test multiple communication
strategies in the report (also included here).

Uses the ma-gym environment (https://github.com/koulanurag/ma-gym), install that repo, and then replace the lumberjacks.py file with the file
in this 'env' folder. Our environment modifies the original lumberjacks to fully implement walls/obstacles.
